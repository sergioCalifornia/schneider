            Tap-off units can be installed on the busway in just a few seconds using the fast fit system - a unique tool free mounting mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The units are available with a range of devices including MCBs and MCCBs. The standard range employs MCBs and these are typically available in 10, 14, 22 and 50kAIC variants in ratings of 15, 20, 30, 50 and 60A and in Single Pole (SP), Double Pole (DP) and Triple Pole (TP); either with or without metering.

              Tap-off Installation Overview
            </h3>
            <p>
              The tap-off actuator cannot be operated without the tap-off first being mounted on the busway. This feature works in combination with the switching device interlock which is fitted as standard. The interlock prevents the switching device(s) from being turned on before installation / actuation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the tap-off and busway have mechanical features which control orientation to ensure that the tap-off cannot be mounted incorrectly. The tap-off conductor connection springs are fully shrouded throughout the mounting operation which also provides for the make first, break last of the case ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once installed on the busway the patent applied for actuator can then be operated with the supplied actuator key. With the actuator turned ON the interlock is released and can be retracted to allow the switching device to be turned ON.
